Which Arabic?</p> <p>There is a common type of Arabic called "classical Arabic" (fusha) which stretches back at least 1000 years back. It's still used today for most media (eg. newspapers, textbooks) and in universities.</p> <p>Beyond this, each country has its own dialect (or slang) version of Arabic. This includes both use of vocabulary, and also actual grammar (or ignoring the classical grammar).</p> <p>While some of the sample questions on Area 51 talk about Arabic in a specific area, the question is really how we should plan and organize questions, or whether we should focus exclusively on classical Arabic.</p> " OwnerUserId="20" LastEditorUserId="20" LastEditDate="2015-07-14T22:27:41.087" LastActivityDate="2015-07-15T16:43:23.787" Title="Which Arabic are we talking about?"

For learners, learning at least one dialect is often considered a necessary part of learning the Arabic language (and is pretty important if you actually want to visit a country).</p> <p>This does mean we should be careful with tagging questions, and it also means we should be open to questions having multiple answers corresponding to different regions. But the StackExchange format is well-suited to that, and other sites handle the same issue fine. (For instance, on Academia, many questions have multiple answers with begin by explaining which fields the answer is relevant to.)</p> <p>One final point: fusha refers to both Classical Arabic and Modern Standard Arabic. These languages are pretty similar, but there are some usage differences. So whether or not we include the regional dialects, we should keep in mind that some questions may have multiple answers depending on the language variant (and tag accordingly).</p> " OwnerUserId="5" LastActivityDate="2015-07-14T19:16:18.303" CommentCount="2"/>

That's why Quran was sent to Mohammed in 7 different tongues (dialects), not be confused with Qira'at (القراءات). The common dialect at that time was لغة قريش. It is called Arabic mainly because of the race, not because of the language itself. </p> <p>Anyway, same thing is applicable now, the classical Arabic we see now is mainly from Quran and Current Quran is mainly from the Quraish version (one of the seven dialects). In addition to that, each country/region/tribe of Arabs has its own dialect/accent, nothing new here as this was the case throughout history. </p> <p>To answer your question, this site should be about all Arabic Language variants (classic or dialects) especially that almost all Arabs are capable of understanding each other mutually with no problems.</p> " OwnerUserId="9" LastActivityDate="2015-07-14T20:05:50.737" CommentCount="4"/>
  <row Id="5" PostTypeId="2" ParentId="1" CreationDate="2015-07-14T20:06:44.950" Score="7" Body="<p>As I see it, this issue can be broken into two distinct concerns:</p> <ol> <li>Should we as a site cater to questions <em>about</em> dialectual variants of Arabic?</li> <li>Should we as a site encourage posts <em>written</em> in dialectual variants of Arabic?</li> </ol> <p>For the first case, I think questions <em>about</em> different dialects should be allowed, for much the same reason Henry mentioned: <a href="http://meta.arabic.stackexchange.com/a/3/10">The regional dialects form a large portion of Arabic as it's spoken today</a>. Cutting dialects out of the scope would likely cut out a significant majority of our potential activity.</p> <p>For the second case, however, I feel that there's value in establishing some clear guidelines to prevent the site from just becoming a mish-mash of dialects. I would suggest the following:</p> <ol> <li><p>Consider English and Fusha as the "official" languages of this site</p> <ul> <li>Assuming that the majority of our users can (a) understand Fusha, and (b) understand English, seems to be a reasonable compromise (short of just abandoning English-language entirely, which given most of the posts on the site so far (including this meta) are written in English is probably going to be a hard sell)</li> <li>Using regional dialects in meta discussions should be expressly discouraged; community opinion can only truly be gauged if the bulk of the community can reasonably <em>understand</em> what is being discussed, and many Arabic dialects are not mutually understandable. </li> <li>Meta posts, policy discussions, FAQs with any sort of "official" weight <em>must</em> be written in one or the other (ideally both). <ul> <li>Any meta posts which the Stack Exchange community team (rather than just the site community/moderators) may need to be aware of must be written in English, as few if any of them are fluent in Arabic. In particular, this would include things like bug reports and feature requests.</li> </ul></li> </ul></li> <li><p>Allow questions on the main page in regional dialects, but only if they're expressly <em>about</em> some aspect of that dialect, and <em>tagged appropriately</em>.</p> <ul> <li>Users should be allowed to ask questions in the manner which is most comfortable to them when possible; using their own dialect seems safe, so long as any possible answer would be relevant to that dialect</li> <li>It is reasonable to assume that any experts capable of answering a question <em>about</em> a particular dialect is also <em>fluent</em> in that particular dialect. Conversely, it is reasonable to assume that any experts <em>not</em> fluent in that particular dialect are poorly qualified to answer questions <em>about</em> that particular dialect.</li> <li>This allows users fluent/not-fluent in particular dialects to selectively ignore/highlight/select questions that they can actually understand based on tags.</li> </ul></li> <li>Insist that answers on the main page only use dialect if the question is written in that dialect. <ul> <li>English questions should get English answers, and Arabic questions should get Arabic answers.</li> <li>Even if a question is tagged with a dialect, if it's asked in (a) Fusha, or (b) English, so must the answer be written</li> </ul></li> </ol> <p>In short, the only time a dialect should be used is if it&hellip;</p> <ol> <li>&hellip;is a question about and tagged with that particular dialect, or</li> <li>&hellip;is an answer posted to a question using that dialect.</li> </ol> <p>Otherwise, either Fusha or English should be used. From my understanding (I am hardly an Arabic native) Fusha is rather universally <em>understood</em> among Arabic speakers, even when it's rarely if ever actually <em>spoken</em>. So establishing it as the <em>lingua franca</em> of Arabic here makes sense to me.</p> " OwnerUserId="10" LastEditorUserId="10" LastEditDate="2015-07-15T16:43:23.787" LastActivityDate="2015-07-15T16:43:23.787" CommentCount="0"/>

Likewise, if the question is in Arabic there is no use writing in a totally different language (English) since that person is speaking Arabic, and this is Arabic SE after-all.</p> <p>We should probably encourage this stance and punish those who do not follow it with downvotes to try and create some norm, else I can see this quickly becoming a mess.</p> <p>We should also allocate tags for dialects as suggested. We need to be more careful about this last point though and I am still unclear exactly how we should structure this. It might come down to just seeing what actual users do and then cleaning their process up into something workable.</p> " OwnerUserId="56" LastActivityDate="2015-07-14T20:27:38.187" CommentCount="3"/>
